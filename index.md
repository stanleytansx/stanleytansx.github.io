## About Me

I am a <a href="https://tri.yale.edu/fellows/cullman-joint-degree-program" target="_blank">Cullman Fellow</a> pursuing my PhD at Yale University and the New York Botanical Garden.
Using field experiments, computational genomics, and machine learning models, I study the (i)
influence of microbes on plant communities in tropical forests and (ii) the effects of climate change
on the health and resilience of tropical forest ecosystems. My work aims to inform policies and ecosystem
management practices to create healthier forests, for the benefit of human societies and economies. 

## Research Interests

- **Plant Biology and Forest Ecology:** plant-microbe interactions and communities; ecosystem resilience 
- **Ecosystem Conservation and Health:** non-market based financial mechanisms for forest conservation; one health
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition for plant identification
