## About Me

I am a Lewis B. Cullman fellow pursuing my PhD at Yale University and the New York Botanical Garden.
Using field experiments, computational genomics methods, and machine learning models, I study the (i)
influence of microbes on plant communities in tropical forests and (ii) the effects of climate change
on the health and productivity of tropical forest ecosystems. My work informs policies and ecosystem
management practices to create healthier forests, for the benefit of human societies and economies. 

## Research Interests

- **Plant Biology and Forest Ecology:** plant-microbe interactions, life history strategies, plant functional traits
- **Ecosystem Services:** financing forest conservation, one health, urban forests and parks
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition for plant phenotyping, plant stress and disease detection
