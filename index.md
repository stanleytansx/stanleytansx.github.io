## About Me

I am graduate researcher and teaching fellow pursuing my PhD at Yale University and the New York Botanical Gardens, 
where I am also a Lewis B. Cullman Fellow. I employ field experiments, computational genomics, and machine learning models to 
study the influence of plant pathogens on the ecology and evolution of tropical forests. My research informs policies
and ecosystem management practices to create healthier forests, for the benefit of human societies and economies.

## Research Interests

- **Forest Ecology:** plant-pathogens dynamics, life history strategies, functional traits
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition for plant phenotyping, stress and disease detection, remote sensing of forest health
- **Machine Learning Applications:** big data synthesis, clustering and dimension reduction, supervised learning

## News

- **[Aug 2024]** I joined the Comita Lab at Yale University and the New York Botanical Gardens. 
- **[May 2024]** I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies (First Class Honours).
