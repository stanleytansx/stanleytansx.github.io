## About Me

I am a graduate researcher and teaching fellow pursuing my PhD at Yale University. I am also a Lewis B. Cullman Fellow at
the New York Botanical Gardens. I employ field experiments, computational genomics, and machine learning models to study 
the influence of plant pathogens on the ecology and evolution of tropical forests. My research informs policies
and ecosystem management practices to create healthier forests, for the benefit of human societies and economies.

## Research Interests

- **Forest Ecology:** plant-pathogens dynamics, life history strategies, functional traits
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition for plant phenotyping, stress and disease detection, remote sensing of forest health
- **Machine Learning:** big data synthesis, clustering and dimension reduction, supervised learning
